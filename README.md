### A rails app created for the Berytech 2020 Hackathon

## Problems

- Lack of data and statistics on fish catching in Lebanon
- Monopolization of fresh seafood by middleman fish markets
- High prices of fresh seafood due to monopolization
- Fishermen are unable to reach customers which forces them to be used by fish markets
- Consumers are skeptical about the quality of fresh fish at markets since they are known to cheat and market old fish as fresh
- Consumers donâ€™t know how to get access to fresh fish via fishermen directly

## Solution

#### An app that connects fishermen to consumers directly
